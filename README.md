# Udemy Score Keeper
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS</strong>

Here’s my first project for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">the Udemy course I’m taking</a>: A simple scoreboard webpage via DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

It’s nice to be writing some JS again. I’m tempted to dive deeper into the software design aspect of this one, but I’ll keep moving.

Based on my understanding of what MVC is, learning that soon will help with my confusion with how to best organize code like this..
